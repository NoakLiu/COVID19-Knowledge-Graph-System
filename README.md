# Covid19-Knowledge-Graph-System
A research project about construction of Covid19 spatial-tempal knowledge graph, then analysis, tracking, visuzalization of the potential infection paths on the knowledge graph.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 

• I design and implement an end-to-end automated COVID-19 epidemiological analysis framework AVESA , which solves the inefficiency of traditional manual epidemiological analysis. 

• I design and implement a knowledge extraction model based on the combination of horizontal fusion, vertical fusion and deep learning, which solves the problem of low performance of directly transfer models trained in other fields. 

• I design and implement a complete set of the automated construction process of the epidemiological knowledge graph of COVID-19 and generate an epidemiological knowledge graph with 550 nodes and 1385 edges based on existing case reports text. 

• I establish this complete reasoning rules with different dimensions based on the epidemiological knowledge graph and present visualized results. These results provide an essential basis for epidemiological survey workers to select the next epidemic control strategies. 

• I design a series of comparative experiments for applications, conduct experiments, compare results, and finally demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the AVESA framework.
